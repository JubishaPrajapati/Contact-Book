The Contact Book App is a user-friendly web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that allows users to efficiently manage their personal contacts. Each registered user can securely log in and perform CRUD operations on their own list of contacts. The app ensures data privacy by linking each contact entry to a specific user through authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Features include adding new contacts with essential information such as name, email, and phone number, editing or removing existing contacts, and viewing a personalized dashboard.
